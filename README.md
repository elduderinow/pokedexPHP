## WHAT IS A POKEDEX
The Pokédex (Japanese: ポケモン図鑑 illustrated Pokémon encyclopedia) is a digital encyclopedia created by Professor Oak as an invaluable tool to Trainers in the Pokémon world. ... They may give background information on the habitat or activities of a Pokémon in the wild or other information on the Pokémon's history or anatomy.

## PURPOSE
This is a recycled project from this repo: https://github.com/elduderinow/pokedex
The purpose of this project is to strip all the JS and replace it with PHP to learn the new back-end language.

## FUNCTIONALITIES
- Working lookup button input of pokemon names and or ID nr.
- Stats like NAME, HP, ATTACK and TYPE are displayed.
- A brief description of the pokemon.
- 4 random abilities every time you run the same pokemon.
- 2 passive abilities are also displayed
- The previous form of the evolution is displayed.
- The ID nr is displayed
- Random button 
- prev and nex button
- Bg changes in a gradient (from top to bottom) based on 2 types of the pokemon, if only 1 type, there's only one color.
- The pokemons are done in OOP.

## PROGRESS
- Setting up the local host, maria DB, vhost etc was quite easy. We had a good and clear guide on doing this.

- I'm not going to write different HTML & CSS as I liked the design and want to convert JS to PHP instead of stripping everything.

- I have fetched the API data but struggled with accessing it, my knowledge of PHP is not quite that good.

- I decided that before continuing making the pokedex I need to do a crash course on codecademy to understand the basics of PHP, this will help me in progressing faster through the assignment with a deeper understanding.

- The crash course was usefull but was going too slow, so I watched a youtube tut on double speed instead.

- I first struggled with accessing the multidimensional array in PHP, but once found it was easy to navigate. 

- Using classes in PHP for the first time was also confusing, It all works, but I think I didn't quite get and/or understand the full potential yet. There's much too learn, but I am excited.


## THE PROJECT ITSELF & MY OPINION
Good call to recycle a project we already did to learn PHP. Had fun doing it and again learned a bunch of stuff.
