# Title: Pokedex PHP

Creating a Pokedex in HTML and CSS and javascript.

- Repository: `pokedexPHP`
- Link: https://github.com/elduderinow/pokedexPHP
- Language: HTML, SCSS, PHP

## WHAT IS A POKEDEX
The Pokédex (Japanese: ポケモン図鑑 illustrated Pokémon encyclopedia) is a digital encyclopedia created by Professor Oak as an invaluable tool to Trainers in the Pokémon world. ... They may give background information on the habitat or activities of a Pokémon in the wild or other information on the Pokémon's history or anatomy.

## PURPOSE
This is a recycled project from this repo: https://github.com/elduderinow/pokedex
The purpose of this project is to strip all the JS and replace it with PHP to learn the new back-end language.

## FUNCTIONALITIES
- Working lookup but input of pokemon names and or ID nr.
- Stats like NAME, HP, ATTACK and TYPE are displayed.
- A brief discription of the pokemon.
- 4 random abilities every time you run the same pokemon.
- 2 passive abilities are also displayed
- The previous form of the evolution is displayed.
- The ID nr is dispayed

## PROGRESS
- Setting up the local host, maria DB, vhost etc was quite easy. We had a good and clear guide on doing this.

- I'm not going to write different HTML & CSS as I liked the design and want to convert JS to PHP instead of stripping everything.

- I have fetched the API data but struggled with accessing it, my knowledge of PHP is not quite that good.

- I decided that before continuing making the pokedex I need to do a crash course on codecademy to understand the basics of PHP, this will help me in progressing faster through the assignment with a deeper understanding.
